      <description>IoT enabled rabbit feeder, automatic and controllable via Internet.
Github repository: https://github.com/conejoninja/home_food
Idea and motivation The main idea was to be able to feed these two little rascals even when I&amp;rsquo;m not at home. Twice a day, a small quantity at breakfast and a bigger one for dinner (non-spoiled rabbits are supposed to eat timothy during the day when they are not sleeping). I would like to also measure the temperature in case it gets too hot, since rabbits don&amp;rsquo;t do well on hot weather.</description>

      <description>Simple protocol to discover and communicate with IoT devices on a network. The devices communicate with each other through the same central server(s) (a single server or a mesh), that may or may not be in the same local network. This makes possible the communication of devices in different physical networks.
Discovery of devices Devices that join the network will broadcast their description. The message will be send to the discovery channel.</description>

      <description>Amateur project to automate a few task in my home and communicate with some IoT devices. I used a mix of languages, frameworks and platforms. I will try to document as much as possible, but remember, this is an amateur project.
Global view In order to interact together, devices communicates with each other through a MQTT server using a custom JSON-based protocol. Besides the devices, there are a few &amp;ldquo;modules&amp;rdquo; too, those modules are programs that consume the MQTT messages, perform actions based of information and allow human interaction (Web, App).</description>
