      <description>IoT enabled rabbit feeder, automatic and controllable via Internet.
Github repository: https://github.com/conejoninja/home_food
Idea and motivation Learn from the experience and improve the previous versions of the feeder.
As with the old prototype, the feeder will wake up each 15 minutes, send the temperature and humidity to a server and check if it&amp;rsquo;s time to feed the monsters. It&amp;rsquo;s as autonomous as possible (it will feed them if it&amp;rsquo;s time, even if there&amp;rsquo;s no internet connection).</description>

      <description>IoT enabled rabbit feeder, automatic and controllable via Internet.
Github repository: https://github.com/conejoninja/home_food
Idea and motivation The main idea was to be able to feed these two little rascals even when I&amp;rsquo;m not at home. Twice a day, a small quantity at breakfast and a bigger one for dinner (non-spoiled rabbits are supposed to eat timothy during the day when they are not sleeping). I would like to also measure the temperature in case it gets too hot, since rabbits don&amp;rsquo;t do well on hot weather.</description>
